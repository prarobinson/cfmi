Quick Start:

mkdir cfmi
virutalenv .env
. .env/bin/activate
git clone http://github.com/nocko/cfmi.git
cd cfmi
python setup.py develop

A development server can be started by running: python cfmi

More Info:

The basic development deployment above uses in memory sqlite. It does
not create the tables necessary for most functionality to work. It is
expected that you will provide a more appropriate configuration
modeled after production_settings.py.dist.

You can load this production config by exporting the path to the
module as CFMI_CONFIG:

export CFMI_CONFIG=$HOME/production_settings.py

or you may use the enclosed wsgi script to load them from the
production_settings.py file in the working directory

Testing:

The test suite can be invoked by running:

  python setup.py nosetests

Happy Hacking
